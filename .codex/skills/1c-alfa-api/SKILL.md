description: Diagnose and stabilize integrations with 1C Alfa API endpoints used by this repository. Use when troubleshooting getitemslist/getitem/setmessage/getroles/getqrcomlectinfo behavior, search misses, pagination offsets (ncount/count), filter precedence, or when designing reliable client request patterns against agrapp.agregatka.ru.

# 1C Alfa API Skill

Follow this workflow for incidents and implementation tasks related to the 1C Alfa API.

## Workflow

1. Reproduce the issue with the exact URL/params from the report.
2. Re-run the same request with `ncount=0` to check offset-related misses.
3. Verify if more than one `filterby/filterval` pair is being sent by client code.
4. Check client pagination reset behavior:
   - `ncount` must reset to `0` on new search/filter/sort.
5. Confirm backend behavior in module dump (`1c_alfa_common_modules.txt`):
   - `getitemslist` routing
   - `ПОДОБНО`/`filtertype=value`
   - skip-by-`ncount` logic after query result
6. Propose the smallest safe fix:
   - client-side reset first
   - backend hardening only as optional defense

## Reliability Rules

- Treat query changes as a new query signature and start from page 0.
- Prefer explicit search over implicit department filter when API supports one active filter pair.
- Keep document names exact and in Russian.
- Avoid contract changes unless explicitly requested.

## Output Checklist

- Root cause statement (client vs API behavior).
- Reproduction matrix (`ncount>0` vs `ncount=0`).
- Proposed fix with low regression risk.
- Validation steps and expected results.

## References

- Read [API behavior reference](references/api-behavior.md) for known endpoint semantics and troubleshooting shortcuts.
